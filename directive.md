Travel Booking and Destination Explorer using Angular and TypeScript
Objective:
Develop an Travel Booking and Destination Explorer application using Angular and TypeScript
that allows users to browse destinations, view travel packages, and book trips. This project will
provide hands-on experience with Angular components, routing, services, dependency injection,
forms, observables, and Angular Material, while focusing on building a visually engaging and
responsive single-page application (SPA).
Reference Tools & Technologies:
• Framework: Angular (v17 or latest)
• Language: TypeScript
• UI Library: Angular Material
• Development Tools: Node.js, Angular CLI, Visual Studio Code
• Mock Backend: JSON Server or static JSON files for destinations, packages, and
bookings
Approach:
1. Setup and TypeScript Fundamentals
✓ Initialize an Angular project using Angular CLI.
✓ Define TypeScript interfaces and classes for Destination, Package, User, and
Booking.
✓ Apply TypeScript features like interfaces, data types, and inheritance to structure
data models effectively.
2. Angular Architecture and Component Design
✓ Build modular and reusable Angular components:
❖ destination-list – displays available destinations with images and summaries
❖ package-detail – shows package details, itinerary, and price
❖ booking-form – allows users to book trips and choose preferences
❖ user-dashboard – displays user booking history
❖ navbar – provides global navigation links (Home, Destinations, My
Bookings)
Implement data binding, event binding, and directives (*ngIf, *ngFor, [ngClass],
[ngStyle]) for dynamic and responsive behavior.
